# Akzent: Kotlin Language Modeling System

Welcome to Akzent, the Kotlin Language Modeling System project! This project aims to create a comprehensive framework for defining and mapping phonetic elements of languages, such as vowels and consonants. This foundational step is crucial for various applications, including linguistic research, language learning tools, speech synthesis, and more.

## Introduction

Akzent is designed to facilitate the analysis and synthesis of languages at a phonetic level. By defining and mapping the basic phonetic elements, we aim to support a wide range of applications, from advanced natural language processing tasks to language learning and preservation efforts.

## Features

### Current Features

- **Phonetic Interface**: A base interface for phonetic elements with properties such as name and symbol.
- **Consonant Class**: Represents consonants with articulation place and manner.
- **Vowel Class**: Represents vowels with mouth type and lip type.
- **Phoneme Inventory**: Initial support for defining and storing phonetic elements.

### Coming Soon

- **Phonetic Transcription Tools**: Automatic transcription of text to phonetic representations.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Generate human-like speech from text using defined phonetic rules.
- **Speech Recognition**: Convert spoken words into text by identifying phonetic patterns.
- **Language Learning Tools**: Interactive guides and exercises for language learners.
- **Linguistic Analysis Tools**: Tools for comparing and analyzing phonetic structures across languages.
- **Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) Integration**: Language immersion environments and real-time translation.
- **Advanced Linguistic Features**: Support for morphology, syntax, and grammar.
- **Animations for Language Speak in Games and Cartoons**: Enhance character speech animations with accurate phonetic movements.
